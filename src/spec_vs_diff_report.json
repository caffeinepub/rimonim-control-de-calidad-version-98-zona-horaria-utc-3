  "summary": "The diff implements most frontend performance optimizations (REQ-13, REQ-14, REQ-16, REQ-17, REQ-19, REQ-20) and backend optimizations (REQ-18) from the BuildRequest. However, REQ-15 (virtual scrolling/pagination for Historial table) appears to be missing or incomplete in the diff evidence.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Implement virtual scrolling or pagination for the Historial page table to handle large datasets efficiently, preventing performance degradation when displaying hundreds of control records",
      "reason": "The Historial.tsx diff shows debouncing implementation and search filtering, but no evidence of virtual scrolling (e.g., react-window, react-virtualized) or pagination controls (page state, limit/offset, pagination UI components). The file uses standard Table components without virtualization.",
