  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo, frontend-file-summaries.txt, and project_state.json. Based on the available evidence, some requirements appear to be addressed (backend access control initialization, QueryClient configuration, role-based views), but most debugging and verification requirements (REQ-40 through REQ-46) lack explicit evidence of investigation, error identification, or targeted fixes in the diff summary. The diff does not show console error documentation, root cause analysis, or specific fix implementations that would satisfy the debugging requirements.",

      "id": "REQ-40",
      "requirement": "Investigate and identify the root cause preventing the application from starting or functioning after the most recent deployment, checking for JavaScript runtime errors, React rendering failures, query initialization problems, or authentication flow breaks",
